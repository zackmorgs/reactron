# Reactron
ez-pz boilerplate for electron + react + scss

## Features
- hot reloading
- dev your app in the browser
- dev app in the electron frame

i hope to make this better in the future, but for now it's very simple to understand as I want something that is fluid to work in.

### Getting Started

### Basic Usage:
- Download

`git clone https://github.com/zackmorgs/reactron.git`
- Install dependencies (i have 5 now)

`npm install`

- also:

`npm install -d`
- .. i think. ill update this later.


to start, just reflexively type
`npm start`

after that, just head on over to ol' [localhost](http://localhost:3000) AND/OR check it out in your electron app shell
